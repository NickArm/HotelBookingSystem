## About The Project

A comprehensive Hotel Booking Reservation System, designed from A-Z, offering seamless user role management with multi-authentication for both users and admins. This system provides granular roles and permissions, and a checkout process devoid of shipping packages, supporting multiple payment methods like COD and Stripe. Key features include advanced room search, inventory management, manual and online booking capabilities, real-time notifications, and automated reports. Reservations are streamlined with room availability management, date-based search, Excel import/export, PDF invoices, and custom email notifications. The platform incorporates professional themes for both frontend and backend, supports password changes, dynamic email configuration, and custom pagination, providing a feature-rich experience for both administrators and guests.
